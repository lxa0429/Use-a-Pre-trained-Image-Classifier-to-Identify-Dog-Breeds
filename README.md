# Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

## Project Overview

This repository contains the first project from my work in the **AI Programming with Python Nanodegree** from Udacity. The project involves using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify dog breeds from images. I have successfully completed this project, demonstrating my ability to apply transfer learning and evaluate model performance across various datasets.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- **Mastery of Transfer Learning Techniques**
- **Effective Utilization of Pre-trained Models**
- **Evaluation of Model Performance Across Various Datasets**
